/// ==============================
/// 
/// _author_:         Seanje Lenox-Wise / Nova Dawn  
/// _version_:        0.0.1  
/// _status_:         Active  
/// _phase_:          Phase 0 â€” System Declaration  
/// _created_:        2025-06-15  
/// _last updated_:   2025-06-15  
/// _license_:        CreativeWorkzStudio LLC â€” Kingdom-First Proprietary Use  
/// _component_:      Core Manifest (lib.rs)  
/// _project_:        OmniCore / OmniCode  
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Description & Purpose**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _description_:    This is the root `lib.rs` file for the **code/** folder, serving as the **canonical gateway** to all internal crates and submodules within the OmniCore system.
/// 
/// _functionality role_: Provides a structured export layer, exposing all internal module trees (Gate, Watchtower, Tablet, etc.) and centralized system utilities.
/// 
/// _system strategy_: Mirrors the behavior of a namespace registrar, aligning internal folders to be available across the codebase and ensuring architectural coherence.
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Dependencies**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _dependencies_:
/// - Internal modules only (exposed via `mod.rs` structure)
/// - Each internal crate manages its own third-party dependencies
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Performance & Runtime Behavior**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _runtime behavior_:
/// - No runtime code; this file is declarative only.
/// - Acts at **compile time** to resolve module trees.
/// - Zero-cost abstraction â€” no side effects or IO handling.
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Version Tracking**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _version tracking_:
/// - Main branch: `dev`  
/// - Release candidate: `rc-v1.0`  
/// - Stable version: `v0.1.0`  
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Component Linkage**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _component linkage_:
/// - Declares all public-facing modules under `code/`
/// - Exposes: `Gate`, `Watchtower`, `Tablet`, `Util`, and others as they come online
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Notes**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _notes_:
/// - This file is the **single source of truth** for routing system-level submodules.
/// - Never add logic here â€” only declarations and module references.
/// - Designed to be as readable as it is precise. Treat this as the scroll that announces what the system is and what it contains.
/// 
/// ==============================

/// ==============================
/// Opening Code Block (Pre-Logic) â€” Root System Declarations
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This file exposes all major internal submodules of OmniCore.
/// - Each declared `mod` maps directly to a folder in the `code/` root.
/// - The order and structure mirror the architectural layers and priorities of the system.
///
/// **Modules Declared**:
/// - **`gate`**: Terminal interaction layer (CLI / GUI)
/// - **`watchtower`**: Debugger, logger, and spiritual diagnostic tool
/// - **`tablet`**: Assembler, opcode processor, low-level compute
/// - **`util`**: Shared types, schemas, traits, and constants
///
/// **Visibility**:
/// - All modules declared here are made **public** (`pub mod`) to allow system-wide access and reuse.

/// ==============================
/// Module Declarations
/// ==============================

pub mod gate;         // Terminal-based interface system
pub mod watchtower;   // Logging and debugging component
pub mod tablet;       // Assembler, opcode, and system processor (future work)
pub mod shared;       // Shared types, traits, and core schemas

/// ==============================
/// Body Code Block (Logic)
/// ==============================
///
/// This file contains **no logic**, functions, or runtime procedures.
/// Its role is declaration-only: define what the `code/` namespace provides to the outside system.
/// All logic flows are encapsulated in the respective submodule trees (e.g., `gate/`, `watchtower/`, `util/`).

/// ==============================
/// Closing Code Block (Post-Logic) â€” lib.rs for OmniCore
/// ==============================
///
/// **Version History**:
/// - **v0.0.1**: First declaration of system modules and structure alignment.
///
/// **Notice**:
/// - Unauthorized alterations to this root manifest are prohibited.
/// - Any misalignment in this file can cause downstream module linkage to fail.
/// - Treat this file as the **declaration scroll** that the system reads to recognize its own parts.
///
/// **Next Steps**:
/// - As additional modules (e.g., `tablet`, `nova`, `compiler`) come online, add them here for global exposure.
/// - Maintain this file with great care â€” it represents the entire OmniCore system externally.
///
/// **Current Phase Notes**:
/// - **Phase 0**: Basic structure defined and exposed. Internal modules begin to implement functionality independently.
/// - Later phases will build off this manifest as new system folders and components are implemented.
