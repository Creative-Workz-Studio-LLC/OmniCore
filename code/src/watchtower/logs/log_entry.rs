/// ==============================
/// **Description & Purpose**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _description_:    Provides basic logging functionality for **Watchtower**, enabling the system to log events with timestamps. Logs are stored in a `.log` file for future reference and monitoring.
/// 
/// _log schema_: Timestamp, Event Message
/// _runtime effects_: Event logging, file-based logging system
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Dependencies**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _dependencies_:
/// - `serde` (for serializing log entries into structured JSON)
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Performance & Runtime Behavior**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _runtime performance_:
/// - The system is optimized for basic logging needs. Expected to perform well for low-traffic use cases.
/// - Logs are appended to the file continuously, with no overhead beyond simple file writes.
/// - Performance optimizations (e.g., log rotation) may be considered in later phases.
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Version Tracking**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _version tracking_:
/// - Main branch: `dev`
/// - Release candidate branch: `rc-v1.0`
/// - Stable version: `v0.1.0`
///
/// ==============================
/// **Component Linkage**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _component linkage_:
/// - Relies on: `watchtower` (central module managing logging functionality)
/// - Can be used by: `gate`, `monitoring`, `events` (to log various system activities)
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Notes**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _notes_:
/// - This module is essential for tracking events and monitoring system health in real time.
/// - The log format is simple, providing timestamps and event messages. Future work may include adding log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
/// - The current log system writes directly to a `.log` file. Future phases will explore log management, such as **log rotation** and **log parsing**.
/// - This is the starting point for building **Watchtower's monitoring capabilities**, which will grow as more features are added.
/// 
/// ==============================

/// ==============================
/// Opening Code Block (Pre-Logic) â€” Log Entry for Watchtower
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This module is responsible for logging events in the **Watchtower** system. 
/// - It provides functionality to log events, associate them with timestamps, and store them in a file (`watchtower.log`) for future reference.
///
/// **Imports/Submodules**:
/// - **`std::fs::OpenOptions`**: This standard library module is used to handle file operations, including opening the `watchtower.log` file, creating it if necessary, and appending data.
/// - **`std::io::Write`**: This module provides methods to write data to the file.
/// - **`std::time::SystemTime`**: This module allows us to retrieve the current system time, which will be used to generate the timestamp for each log entry.
///
/// **Function Declarations**:
/// - **`log_event()`**: The function that will handle the logging of events. It formats the event message with a timestamp and writes it to the `watchtower.log` file.
/// - **`get_timestamp()`**: A helper function that returns the current timestamp, used in the `log_event()` function for logging purposes.
///
/// **Why is This Module Needed?**:
/// - Logging is crucial for tracking the behavior and performance of the system. It helps in **debugging** and provides a record of significant system events for monitoring and troubleshooting.
///
/// **Future Enhancements**:
/// - Support for **log levels** (e.g., INFO, ERROR).
/// - Implement **log rotation** to handle file size limits.
/// - Integration with external monitoring systems for real-time tracking and alerts.

/// ==============================
/// Imports and Submodules
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This section declares the necessary imports and submodules required for the **Watchtower log entry functionality**.
/// - These modules are responsible for file operations (creating and writing to the log file) and for working with timestamps, which are necessary for creating accurate log entries with a timestamp.
///
/// **Submodule Breakdown**:
/// - **`std::fs::OpenOptions`**: This module is part of the Rust standard library and is used for handling file operations. It allows us to open the `watchtower.log` file, create it if it doesn't exist, and append new log entries to it. The ability to both open and append makes it ideal for logging systems that constantly add new data to a file.
/// 
/// - **`std::io::Write`**: This module is part of the Rust standard library and provides the `Write` trait, which enables writing data to files. It's crucial for our ability to write the formatted log message into `watchtower.log`.
/// 
/// - **`std::time::SystemTime`**: This module provides the ability to retrieve the system's current time. We use it to calculate the duration since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970), which helps us generate a reliable timestamp for each log entry.
///
/// **Why Are These Imports Necessary?**:
/// - Without `OpenOptions`, the system wouldn't be able to open or create a log file for writing log entries.
/// - Without `Write`, we wouldn't be able to output log messages to the log file.
/// - Without `SystemTime`, we wouldn't have the capability to generate accurate timestamps for each log entry.
///
/// These modules are fundamental to ensuring that **Watchtower** can track events and store them in a way that's both accessible and reliable for future reference.

/// Import the `OpenOptions` module from `std::fs` to handle file operations.
/// This module allows us to open the `watchtower.log` file, create it if it doesn't exist, 
/// and append new log entries to it.
use std::fs::{OpenOptions};

/// Import the `Write` trait from `std::io` to provide the ability to write data to the file.
/// This is necessary for writing the log entries to the `watchtower.log` file.
use std::io::Write;

/// Import the `SystemTime` module from `std::time` to get the current system time.
/// This is crucial for generating timestamps for each log entry, ensuring that each log is time-stamped.
use std::time::SystemTime;

/// ==============================
/// Body Code Block (Logic)
/// ==============================
///
/// This section handles the logic for logging events in the **Watchtower** system.
/// It includes the functionality to log events with timestamps and save them into a file (`watchtower.log`).
/// The logic consists of two main functions: `log_event()` and `get_timestamp()`. 

/// ==============================
/// Function: log_event
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - Logs an event with a timestamp to the `watchtower.log` file, enabling event tracking and debugging.
/// - This function formats a log message by combining the event description with the current timestamp.
/// - It then opens (or creates) the `watchtower.log` file and appends the log entry.
///
/// **Arguments**:
/// - `event: &str` â€” A reference to a string slice that holds the description of the event being logged. 
///   This could be any string that represents a specific event or action within the system (e.g., "Build started", "Test completed", etc.).
///
/// **Returns**:
/// - This function does not return a value. It directly writes to the `watchtower.log` file.
///
/// **Process**:
/// 1. Calls the `get_timestamp()` helper function to get the current timestamp.
/// 2. Formats the timestamp and event into a log message.
/// 3. Opens (or creates if necessary) the `watchtower.log` file and appends the log message to it.
///
/// **Panics**:
/// - The function will panic if the file operation fails (e.g., if the file cannot be created or written to).
///   The `unwrap()` calls are used to ensure that any errors encountered during file operations are immediately caught and reported.
///
/// **Side Effects**:
/// - Writes the log entry to the `watchtower.log` file, creating it if it doesn't already exist. If the file does exist, the entry is appended to the end.
///
/// **Examples**:
/// ```rust
/// log_event("Build completed successfully");
/// log_event("Test failed due to missing dependencies");
/// ```
/// 
/// **Future Enhancements**:
/// - Support for different **log levels** (e.g., INFO, ERROR).
/// - Implement **log rotation** to manage file size limits and archiving of old logs.
/// - Integration with external monitoring systems for **real-time tracking** and alerts.
pub fn log_event(event: &str) {
    // Retrieve the current timestamp using the helper function
    let timestamp = get_timestamp();

    // Format the log message with the timestamp and event description
    let log_message = format!("[{}] - {}\n", timestamp, event);
    
    // Open the log file for appending, creating it if necessary
    let mut file = OpenOptions::new()
        .create(true) // Create the file if it doesn't exist
        .append(true) // Append to the file if it already exists
        .open("watchtower.log") // Open the file for writing
        .unwrap(); // Unwrap the result or panic if it fails

    // Write the formatted log message to the file
    file.write_all(log_message.as_bytes()).unwrap(); // Unwrap the result or panic if it fails
}

/// ==============================
/// Function: get_timestamp
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This helper function retrieves the current timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).
/// - It is used to generate the timestamp for log entries, ensuring each event has a unique and consistent time reference.
///
/// **Arguments**:
/// - No arguments. This function works independently by fetching the system's current time.
///
/// **Returns**:
/// - A `String` containing the current timestamp, represented as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.
///
/// **Process**:
/// 1. Retrieves the current system time using `SystemTime::now()`.
/// 2. Calculates the duration since the Unix epoch.
/// 3. Converts the duration into seconds using `as_secs()`.
///
/// **Panics**:
/// - If the system time is somehow set before the Unix epoch (a negative duration), the function will panic with the message: `"Time went backwards"`.
///
/// **Side Effects**:
/// - None. This function merely returns the current timestamp as a string, with no external side effects (e.g., no file writes or state changes).
///
/// **Examples**:
/// ```rust
/// let timestamp = get_timestamp();
/// println!("Current timestamp: {}", timestamp);
/// ```
///
/// **Future Enhancements**:
/// - Potential future use of higher precision timestamps (e.g., milliseconds) if needed.
fn get_timestamp() -> String {
    // Retrieve the system's current time
    let time = SystemTime::now()
        .duration_since(SystemTime::UNIX_EPOCH) // Get the duration since the Unix epoch
        .expect("Time went backwards"); // Ensure time has not gone backwards

    // Convert the duration (in seconds) to a string
    let seconds = time.as_secs();

    // Return the timestamp as a string
    seconds.to_string()
}
