/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Description & Purpose**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _description_:    This module manages the logging and monitoring functionality for the **Watchtower**. It connects to the `logs` module to log system events, helping us track key system activities and monitor health.
/// 
/// _log schema_: Event Message (Timestamp logged by `log_event`)
/// _runtime effects_: Logging system activities, allowing external components to trigger log entries when required
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Dependencies**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _dependencies_:
/// - `logs`: Contains the `log_event` function for recording events into the log file.
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Performance & Runtime Behavior**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _runtime performance_:
/// - Lightweight logging with minimal overhead for the current system. 
/// - Performance optimizations may be considered as more complex monitoring or logging features are added in the future (e.g., log rotation, external integrations).
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Version Tracking**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _version tracking_:
/// - Main branch: `dev`
/// - Release candidate branch: `rc-v1.0`
/// - Stable version: `v0.1.0`
///
/// ==============================
/// **Component Linkage**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _component linkage_:
/// - Relies on: `logs` (providing logging functionality)
/// - Can be used by: `monitoring`, `events`, `gate` (other system components that require logging functionality)
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Notes**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _notes_:
/// - The current version of **Watchtower** is minimal and focuses solely on logging system events. Future enhancements will add advanced monitoring capabilities, like real-time tracking and integration with external monitoring systems.
/// - This module will serve as the foundation for the **Watchtower's monitoring capabilities**, evolving as more features are added in future phases.
/// 
/// ==============================

/// ==============================
/// Opening Code Block (Pre-Logic) ‚Äî Watchtower (Logging Subsystem)
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This module serves as the logging subsystem for the **Watchtower** system, responsible for logging events such as system activities or triggered tasks. It ensures that significant system events are timestamped and logged into `watchtower.log`.
/// - The module is designed to be lightweight for basic logging needs, with the potential for growth in the future as the system expands.
///
/// **Imports/Submodules**:
/// - **`logs`**: Contains the function `log_event()` for writing log entries to the `watchtower.log` file. It processes event messages, appends a timestamp, and writes them to the log file.
///
/// **Function Declarations**:
/// - Currently, **watchtower.rs** does not include any direct functions but acts as a central location for calling other logging mechanisms through submodules (like `logs`).
///
/// **Why is This Module Needed?**:
/// - The **Watchtower** is essential for maintaining visibility into system activities and providing debugging information. By logging events with timestamps, we can track system performance and behavior over time.
/// - It is crucial for identifying and resolving issues, as well as keeping a record of all significant system operations.
///
/// **Future Enhancements**:
/// - As the system scales, **log rotation** and support for **log levels** (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG) may be added to provide more control and organization over the logged data.
/// - The **real-time monitoring** feature could be implemented in future phases, enabling instant feedback from system logs.

/// ==============================
/// Imports and Submodules
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This section declares the necessary modules that are required by **Watchtower** for its logging functionality.
/// - It imports submodules responsible for handling logging tasks, file operations, and timestamp generation.
/// - The submodules are integral to the **Watchtower** logging process and are designed to work together in a modular way, allowing easy maintenance and future extensibility.

/// **Submodule Breakdown**:
/// - **`logs`**: This module contains the core logging functionality, specifically the `log_event()` function, which is used to log system events. The events are timestamped and written to the `watchtower.log` file for tracking and monitoring system activity.
///
/// **Why Are These Submodules Necessary?**:
/// - These imports provide the essential functionality for **Watchtower** to operate as a logging system. Without these modules, the system would lack the ability to track events or monitor its state.

/// ==============================
/// Body Code Block (Logic) ‚Äî Watchtower System
/// ==============================
/// 
/// This section handles the logic for monitoring the system and logging events in the **Watchtower** system.
/// It includes the functionality to monitor system events and trigger log entries when significant events occur.
/// The main function in this section is `monitor_and_log()`, which logs the event indicating that system monitoring has started.

/// ==============================
/// Function: monitor_and_log
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This function monitors the system and logs an event indicating the start of monitoring. 
/// - It demonstrates how the **Watchtower** logging system can be used to track the system's activity.
/// - The function calls the `log_event()` function to log that the monitoring has started, providing a simple example of logging an event.
///
/// **Arguments**:
/// - This function does not take any arguments. It uses hardcoded event descriptions to log system activities (e.g., "System monitoring started").
///
/// **Returns**:
/// - This function does not return any value. It performs logging by calling the `log_event()` function, which writes to a file.
///
/// **Process**:
/// 1. It logs an event that the monitoring system has started using the `logs::log_entry::log_event()` function.
/// 2. Any additional logic for monitoring the system (e.g., performance tracking, resource usage, etc.) can be added after the logging step.
///
/// **Panics**:
/// - The function will panic if the `log_event()` function fails to write to the `watchtower.log` file. This can occur if there is a problem with file creation or writing (though the `unwrap()` in `log_event()` will trigger this).
///
/// **Side Effects**:
/// - The event is logged to the `watchtower.log` file, marking the start of the system monitoring process.
///
/// **Examples**:
/// ```rust
/// monitor_and_log();
/// ```
/// 
/// **Future Enhancements**:
/// - Extend this function to monitor other system activities, such as performance metrics or system health checks.
/// - Implement more sophisticated event tracking with different levels of logging (e.g., INFO, ERROR).
/// - Add support for logging real-time system activity continuously, not just at the start.
