/// _version_:        0.0.1  
/// _status_:         Active  
/// _phase_:          Phase 0 â€” Core Structuring  
/// _created_:        2025-06-15

/// _license_:        CreativeWorkzStudio LLC â€” Kingdom-First Proprietary Use  
/// _component_:      Core Utility System  
/// _project_:        OmniCore / OmniCode  
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Description & Purpose**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _description_:    Houses all cross-system utility definitions, including core types, schemas, interfaces, and constants.
/// 
/// _role in system_: Provides foundational scaffolding across modules. Prevents logic bloating by centralizing shared structures.
/// 
/// _design philosophy_: Schema clarity, centralized types, clear interface boundaries, and reusable constants.
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Dependencies**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _dependencies_:
/// - Internal only; no external crates are imported at this level.
/// - Submodules may declare their own dependencies where appropriate.
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Performance & Runtime Behavior**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _runtime behavior_:
/// - Compile-time only struct and type definitions â€” no runtime logic.
/// - Provides high stability and isolation from system state.
/// - Intended for zero-cost abstractions.
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Version Tracking**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _version tracking_:
/// - Main branch: `dev`  
/// - Release candidate: `rc-v1.0`  
/// - Stable version: `v0.1.0`  
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Component Linkage**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _component linkage_:
/// - Used across: `Gate`, `Watchtower`, `Tablet`, and future system components.  
/// - Linked by: `lib.rs` for full-system availability.  
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Notes**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _notes_:
/// - This module is foundational to the structure of OmniCore and should remain stable.
/// â€• All major system schemas should be stored here rather than within specific functional modules.
/// - Every folder must include a `mod.rs` to ensure proper visibility.
/// 
/// ==============================

/// ==============================
/// Opening Code Block (Pre-Logic) â€” Util Modules for OmniCore
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This is the `mod.rs` file for the **Util** system within **OmniCore**.
/// - It serves as the canonical entry point for shared schemas, type declarations, core traits, and constants used throughout the system.
/// - This file does **not contain logic or functions**, only declarations that expose the internal structure of `util/`.
///
/// **Submodules**:
/// - **`constants`**: Houses static values, configuration primitives, and system-wide identifiers.
/// - **`core`**: Low-level core traits, markers, and kernel structures essential for schema linkage.
/// - **`interfaces`**: Interface traits used for component communication and API-style contracts.
/// - **`schemas`**: Rich data structures that define logs, configs, and other structured payloads.
/// - **`types`**: Common types and enums used broadly across multiple components.
///
/// **Design Justification**:
/// - This organization keeps OmniCore clean, predictable, and reduces bloating in functional modules like Gate and Watchtower.
/// - Just as JSON schema files are used to decouple config structure from logic in web systems, `util/` serves as the root schema vault.

/// ==============================
/// Imports and Submodules
/// ==============================

pub mod constants;    // Static values and ID strings
pub mod core;         // Foundational traits and minimal primitives
pub mod interfaces;   // System-wide traits for communication
pub mod schemas;      // Data structure definitions (e.g., logs, configs)
pub mod types;        // Shared enums and common pattern types

/// ==============================
/// Body Code Block (Logic)
/// ==============================
///
/// No logic or runtime behavior exists in this `mod.rs`.
/// Its purpose is structural â€” to expose internal definitions to the rest of the system.
/// All logic and implementations are handled within the submodules.

/// ==============================
/// Closing Code Block (Post-Logic) â€” Util Module for OmniCore
/// ==============================
///
/// **Version History**:
/// - **v0.0.1**: Initial schema vault creation for constants, types, and interfaces.
///
/// **Notice**:
/// - Unauthorized alteration of this code is strictly prohibited.  
/// - **CreativeWorkzStudio LLC (CWS)** disclaims all responsibility for outcomes resulting from unauthorized modifications.
///
/// **Next Steps**:
/// - Begin populating `types` and `schemas` with definitions for logs, command packets, and config layers.
/// - Consider deriving traits (`Serialize`, `Debug`, etc.) in-place for broader interoperability.
/// - Track growing schema and type complexity for potential macro-driven generation.
///
/// **Current Phase Notes**:
/// - **Phase 0**: This setup represents the initial formation of OmniCoreâ€™s schema vault, focused on foundational data structures and clean separation of shared utilities.
/// - Later phases will expand interfaces for runtime configuration, dynamic log filtering, and external API contracts.
