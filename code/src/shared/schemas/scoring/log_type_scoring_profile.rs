/// ==============================
/// ðŸ“Š LogType Scoring Profile â€” Watchtower Logging System
/// ==============================
///
/// This struct defines the scoring profile for each log type within the **Watchtower** system.
/// It provides a mechanism for associating each log type with a severity level, alignment score, 
/// and ensures the correct handling of logs based on their classification.
///
/// The `LogTypeScoringProfile` is used to determine how logs are categorized, scored, 
/// and associated with appropriate severity levels. It works in conjunction with the 
/// `BaseLogEntry` struct and the severity scales (Base 10, Base 5, etc.).

/// Log Type Scoring Profile
/// ==============================
///
/// This struct ties a **LogType** to its severity, alignment, and scoring profile.
/// It dictates how the system interprets the logâ€™s severity, type, and alignment score
/// to track the status of the system more effectively.
