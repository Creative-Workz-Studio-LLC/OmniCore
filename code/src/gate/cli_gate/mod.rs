/// _project_:        OmniCore / OmniCode
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Description & Purpose**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _description_:    Provides a terminal-based interface for interacting with OmniCore, enabling users to run commands like "build", "test", and "deploy".
/// 
/// _command schema_: Command, Action, Expected Outcome, Execution Flow
/// _runtime effects_: Command parsing, system task execution, user feedback output
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Dependencies**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _dependencies_:
/// - None (for now, might link to OmniCode later)
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Performance & Runtime Behavior**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _runtime performance_:
/// - The system is optimized for single-user, low-latency execution.
/// - Expected to scale with multi-user support by Phase 2.
/// - Future optimizations will include **multi-threaded processing** for better efficiency.
///
/// ==============================
/// **Version Tracking**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _version tracking_:
/// - Main branch: `dev`
/// - Release candidate branch: `rc-v1.0`
/// - Stable version: `v0.1.0`
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Component Linkage**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _component linkage_:
/// - Depends on: `handlers` (for handling specific commands like "build", "test")
/// - Relies on: `omnicode` (for translating OmniCode commands into system actions)
/// 
/// ==============================
/// **Notes**
/// ==============================
/// 
/// _notes_:
/// - All commands should eventually be executable through OmniCode itself.
/// - CLI commands currently invoke direct system functions like build, test, and deploy.
/// - Future phases will add OmniCode integration for compiling and executing commands natively.
/// - This module interacts with the Tablet to trigger low-level system operations.
/// - Future work: Expand command set, refine error handling, integrate with OmniCode interpreter.
///
/// ==============================

/// ==============================
/// Opening Code Block (Pre-Logic) â€” CLI Gate Modules for OmniCore
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This is the `mod.rs` file for the **CLI Gate** module within the **OmniCore** project.
/// - It serves as the entry point for organizing submodules related to the **CLI Gate**, which provides a terminal-based interface for interacting with OmniCore.
/// - The file does **not contain any functions** itself, as it is responsible for organizing and importing the necessary submodules for CLI functionality.
///
/// **Imports/Submodules**:
/// - **`commands`**: Handles command parsing and routing, ensuring that user input is processed and directed to the correct functionality.
/// - **`handlers`**: Manages the execution of specific tasks related to commands (e.g., building, testing, deploying the system).
/// - **`utils`**: Provides shared utility functions for tasks like logging, sanitizing inputs, and handling common operations.
/// - **`omnicode`**: Integrates **OmniCode** to allow advanced processing for commands that require more complex handling (e.g., executing code or running specific system-level actions).
///
/// **Function Declarations**:
/// - **There are no functions** in `mod.rs` as this file is purely for organizing and declaring the submodules. Function implementations will reside in their respective submodules, such as `commands`, `handlers`, and `omnicode`.
///
/// **Why is This Module Needed?**:
/// - This `mod.rs` file is essential for **modularizing** the **CLI Gate** functionality, which will evolve as more submodules are added for handling system tasks and processing commands.
/// - It allows for **clear organization**, ensuring that each submodule can be updated or replaced independently, contributing to better maintainability and extendability of the system.
///
/// **Future Enhancements**:
/// - As the project progresses, more submodules may be added to the **CLI Gate**, expanding its command set and functionality.
/// - These additions may include advanced command handling, integration with **OmniCode**, or performance optimizations (e.g., multi-threaded processing for handling concurrent commands).

/// ==============================
/// Imports and Submodules
/// ==============================
///
/// **Purpose**:
/// - This section declares and organizes the **submodules** for the **CLI Gate** functionality in **OmniCore**.
/// - Submodules help us organize different pieces of functionality, making the system modular, maintainable, and easier to extend.
/// - By breaking down the CLI functionality into smaller submodules, we allow each part of the system to evolve independently, ensuring clean code management and clear responsibility for each module.
///
/// **Submodule Breakdown**:
/// - **`commands`**: Handles the **parsing** and **routing** of commands input by the user. This ensures that when a user types a command, it is correctly interpreted and passed to the appropriate part of the system for execution.
/// - **`handlers`**: This submodule is responsible for the **execution** of tasks associated with commands. For example, if a user types "build", this submodule will manage the logic for triggering the build process in the system.
/// - **`utils`**: Contains **utility functions** that are shared across different parts of the **CLI Gate**. These utilities might include logging, sanitization of input, or general helper functions that are used in multiple places in the CLI system.
/// - **`omnicode`**: Integrates the **OmniCode** system to execute advanced commands requiring more complex processing. For instance, commands that require interaction with **OmniCode**'s functionalities will be routed through this submodule to handle the logic.

/// **Why Are These Imports Necessary?**:
/// - The **`commands`** submodule is critical for translating user input into actionable commands within the system.
/// - The **`handlers`** submodule ensures that specific tasks are carried out based on the userâ€™s input, such as building, testing, or deploying.
/// - The **`utils`** submodule allows for **code reuse** and shared functionality (e.g., logging or input validation), avoiding redundancy across the project.
/// - The **`omnicode`** submodule enables the **CLI Gate** to leverage advanced features and execute commands that OmniCode supports.

pub mod commands;      // Handles command parsing and routing
pub mod handlers;      // Event handlers for specific commands (build, test, etc.)
pub mod utils;         // Utility functions for the CLI
pub mod omnicode;      // OmniCode integration for executing commands

/// ==============================
/// Body Code Block (Logic)
/// ==============================
///
/// This section handles the logic of how the CLI Gate connects different modules. 
/// The commands are parsed and routed to appropriate handlers, which execute the tasks.

/// For now, we rely on submodules to handle the detailed logic for each part of the CLI process. 
/// The logic flow happens within these modules:
/// - `commands` for parsing and routing input
/// - `handlers` for command-specific logic (e.g., build, test, deploy)
/// - `utils` for shared functions (e.g., logging, input sanitization)
/// - `omnicode` for executing OmniCode instructions

/// ==============================
/// Closing Code Block (Post-Logic) â€” CLI Gate Module for OmniCore
/// ==============================
///
/// **Version History**:
/// - **v0.0.1**: Initial version of the CLI Gate module, implementing basic command parsing and execution functionality.
///
/// **Notice**:
/// - Unauthorized alteration of this code is strictly prohibited. **CreativeWorkzStudio LLC (CWS)** disclaims all responsibility for any outcomes or issues arising from unauthorized modifications.
///
/// **Next Steps**:
/// - As the system grows, the CLI Gate will be extended to handle more complex commands and integrate more deeply with OmniCode.
/// - Future enhancements will include implementing multi-threaded command execution, error handling, and adding more system tasks for building, testing, and deployment.
/// - Integration with external monitoring and logging systems will be planned in later phases.
///
/// **Current Phase Notes**:
/// - **Phase 0**: The current version of the CLI Gate focuses on the foundational setup, including command parsing and system interaction through text-based input. This phase ensures basic functionality for interacting with OmniCore from the terminal.
/// - Future development will expand the command set and functionality, adding support for real-time user feedback, logging integration, and more robust error handling for system tasks.
