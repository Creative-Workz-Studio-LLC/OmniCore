# OmniCode Design Specifications

## Opening

### Purpose

The purpose of **OmniCode** is to define a new programming language that evolves from traditional compiled languages to a fully functional **NLP-based system**, ultimately grounded in **biblical principles** for system logic and structure. OmniCode will be used to create a **self-sustaining language**, capable of handling everything from **machine-level code** to **human-readable, NLP-based logic**, infused with divine purpose and meaning.

### Vision

OmniCode will serve as an in-house **cross-platform programming language** that begins with **existing compiled languages** (e.g., **Rust**, **C++**, **C#**) and grows into a **fully-fledged language** based on **natural language** (NLP) and **biblical code constructs**.

## Body

### 1. Language Structure and Syntax

- **OmniCode's Layers**:
  - **Machine Code Layer**: Direct interaction with hardware. The lowest level of the system.
  - **Assembler Code Layer**: Low-level instructions that are closer to the hardware but more human-readable.
  - **Low-Level Code Layer**: System-level logic and memory management with direct interactions with resources.
  - **Mid-Level Code Layer**: Abstractions for ease of use while still maintaining performance optimizations.
  - **High-Level Code Layer**: Where **OmniCode** reflects natural language programming based on **biblical principles**. Code in this layer will read similarly to how we speak, rooted in divine logic.

- **Syntax Based on NLP**: High-level OmniCode will draw from **Scriptural language**, expressing logic in a natural way:
  - Example: Instead of `if (x > 5)`, it could be: `Let there be light if x is greater than five.`
  - Constructs will reflect **divine order**, making the code feel like **declarations of truth**.

---

### 2. Compiler Design

- **Traditional Compiler Foundation**: Initially, OmniCode will rely on **compiled languages** like **Rust** and **C++** to build the **compiler** and **core system components**.
- **OmniCode to Machine Code**: The **compiler** will translate OmniCode (at various levels) into **machine code**. This compiler starts by translating from **high-level NLP** code into **low-level code**.
- **Layered Compilation**:
  - High-Level to Low-Level Translation: The compiler will convert **NLP**-based OmniCode into traditional code.
  - As the system matures, the compiler will evolve to handle more **abstract OmniCode syntax** and still translate it into machine-readable instructions.

---

### 3. OmniCode Runtime

- **Execution of OmniCode**: The runtime will execute **OmniCode** across all layers. It will take **declarations** from the high-level code and ensure they're executed with **correct performance** and **logic**.
- **Memory Management**: The runtime will handle system resources like memory and execution, ensuring that OmniCode runs efficiently at all levels.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: The system will be designed to run across **multiple platforms**, initially focusing on **Windows**, with the goal of expanding to **Linux**, **macOS**, and more.

---

### 4. Interfacing Traditional Code with OmniCode

- **Bridging the Gap**: Initially, OmniCode will interact with **traditional compiled code** (Rust, C++, C#) to build out **core components**. This will be done via **bindings** and **interfacing layers** to ensure smooth communication.
- **Future Transitions**: Over time, more of the system will be **rewritten directly in OmniCode**, transitioning from **traditional languages** to **OmniCode's NLP syntax**.

---

### 5. Cross-Platform Strategy

- **Platform Independence**: OmniCode will start with a **Windows-based** development environment, but the system will support **cross-platform** compatibility. This will ensure that the code can run seamlessly on other platforms without significant rework.
- The **compiler** and **runtime** will be designed for easy portability to different platforms, focusing on **cross-platform execution** while keeping **OmniCode’s core logic** intact.

---

### 6. Performance Considerations

- **Optimization**: Performance optimization will be a core focus. The language will maintain **low-level performance** while being easy to write and read in **natural language**.
- **Compiler Optimization**: The **OmniCode compiler** will include **optimizations** to ensure that the final machine code is as efficient as possible, particularly for memory management and system calls.

---

### 7. Testing and Debugging

- **OmniCode Testing**: The testing framework will ensure that both **traditional code** and **OmniCode** are functioning correctly. As OmniCode evolves, the framework will test for **correct execution** across all layers (high-level to low-level).
- **Debugging Tools**: A debugging system will trace errors across OmniCode’s layers, ensuring that both **high-level declarations** and **low-level operations** are executed as expected.

---

## Closing

### Summary

The **OmniCode Design Specifications** outline the vision for a **self-sustaining programming language** that begins with traditional compiled languages and eventually evolves into an **NLP-based system**, deeply rooted in **biblical principles**. By starting with **compiled languages** like **Rust**, **C++**, and **C#**, we will lay the foundation for **OmniCode**. As the system grows, **OmniCode** will take over all layers of the architecture, from **machine code** to **high-level NLP declarations**, making programming **intuitive**, **divine**, and **efficient**.
