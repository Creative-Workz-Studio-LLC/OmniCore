## Opening

### Overview  

In **Phase 0**, the goal is to lay the foundation for the **CLI Gate** and **GUI Gate** in **OmniCore**. The work done today focused on setting up the **root folder** structure and ensuring that the basic framework for these gates is in place. We’ve defined what we are building, but the **actual implementation** will come in the following phases.

This log captures the **initial groundwork** and the clear **intentions** for the next steps.

## Body

### **Key Accomplishments**

- **Root Folder Setup**: We completed the setup of the **root folder** for **OmniCore**. The necessary **directories** and **files** were created to lay the foundation for the system, ensuring the project is organized and ready for future development.
  
- **Defined Phase 0 Focus**: We confirmed that **Phase 0** is focused on the foundational work—starting with the creation of both the **CLI** and **GUI gates**, which will serve as the **primary user interfaces** to interact with OmniCore.

### **Issues Encountered**

- **None at this point**: No real issues have arisen yet as we're in the initial setup phase, with everything focused on getting the project **structured** and **ready** for future work.

### **Next Steps**

- **CLI Gate**: Next, we will focus on **setting up the CLI Gate** to handle **basic command parsing** (e.g., build, test, deploy). This will be the first piece to implement for user interaction with the system.
- **GUI Gate**: After the CLI, we’ll move to setting up the **GUI Gate**, which will provide a more **user-friendly interface**.
- **Integration**: Finally, we will work toward integrating both gates to ensure they trigger the same actions in OmniCore.

## Closing

### **Reflections & Notes**

- **What worked well?**: The setup of the root folder was successful, and we've clearly outlined the first steps for **Phase 0**. We’re now in a position to begin real development with solid organizational groundwork.
  
- **What can be improved?**: No real improvements needed at this stage since we are still in the initial setup phase.
  
- **General thoughts and feelings on progress**: The team is on track and has made great strides in defining what comes next. The next steps are clear, and the project is now set up to grow.
